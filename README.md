### Abstract
Stay a while at The Overlook! A fun project making a booking website for an imaginary hotel. In this project, I used the fetch api to retrieve data including customers, booking info, and room info. In addition to GET requests, I also set up a POST request so the signed in user (customer) can create a new booking. Great attention was paid to the many potential sad paths or nonsensical paths that a site like this has potential for.  In addition, I wrote out a robust testing file focused on preforming unit tests for purely data driven functions. To top it off, I took great care in file organization and code readability, as well as created a site with a high level of accessability.

### Technologies used:
  - JavaScript
  - CSS
  - HTML
  - Mocha / Chai
  - Webpack
  - fetchAPI

### Instructions:
 If you would like to check out my work, first you will need to clone down the turing/overlook-api from Turing, cd into it and run npm install. Next clone down this repo cd into it and run npm install. Then, with both repos open in separate terminals, run mpm start for each. In the terminal for this repository there should be a line stating that it is now running on localhost:8080. Copy and paste that into your prefered browser and you should be good to go!
